Limit Order
===========

Most users have experience placing limit orders on centralized exchanges such as Binance and Kraken, or on traditional finance exchanges like Forex and Robinhood. When a limit order is placed on a centralized platform, such agencies determine how they would like to fill the limit orders by themselves, and to a degree, users have to trust them to do it in good faith. Wisp’s limit order function is decentralized and trustless, which means there isn’t necessarily a specific agency filling limit orders, but rather many different and autonomous entities, all following the parameters set by the users.

**What is a limit order?**[**​**](https://docs.sushi.com/docs/Products/Limit%20Order%20V2#what-is-a-limit-order)**​**

A limit order is a request to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price. As distinct from a market order, which executes immediately after an order is placed, a limit order will not execute unless the asset reaches the price set by the user. If the asset reaches this price, the order may be partially or completely filled, depending on market conditions. Limit orders are used to anticipate future price action, so they usually have an expiration that can be adjusted by the user. The user can set the expiration so that the order will either expire or be filled in the specific amount of time they expect the price to reach the limit. It is also possible to place orders with no expiration, and simply cancel them as needed.
