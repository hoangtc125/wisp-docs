The Forest - Stake WISP
=======================

**Stake WISP, earn WISP!**

WispSwap now offers The Forest pools with two staking options: flexible staking or fixed-term staking.

What’s the difference between “Flexible” and “Fixed-Term” staking?[](#whats-the-difference-between-flexible-and-fixed-term-staking)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With both, you can simply stake your **WISP** tokens to earn more **WISP** tokens with no deposit fees—both staking options auto-compound **WISP** rewards for you. Flexible staking allows users to stake **WISP** and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please. Fixed-term staking allows users to maximise their yield and earn even more **WISP** by locking their staked **WISP** for a period of time they choose, earning a linearly boosted APY compared to flexible staking.

Flexible staking and fixed-term staking are both part of the same pool to allow users easy migration between the two staking options. **Because of this, you can only choose one staking option at a time.** More details about the differences are below.

### 

Flexible Staking[](#flexible-staking)

Stake your **WISP** and forget about it! The **WISP** you stake in this The Forest pools will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.

**If you have WISP staked in flexible staking**

*   ✅ Add more **WISP** to flexible staking
    

*   ✅ Harvest rewards any time
    

*   ✅ Withdraw any time (fees apply for the first 72 hours, see below)
    

*   ✅ Convert all staked **WISP** in flexible to fixed-term staking
    

*   ❌ Add **WISP** to fixed-term staking if you have any **WISP** in flexible staking
    

*   ❌ Convert part of the staked **WISP** in flexible to fixed-term staking
    

**Unstaking fee**

*   **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
    

*   Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
    

*   After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
    

*   The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more **WISP** in the pool.
    

*   This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.
    

**Performance fee**

*   **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
    

*   For example, if the harvest were 1 **WISP**, then 0.02 **WISP** would be subtracted as the performance fee.
    

The **WISP** collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular **WISP** token burns.

This is a good thing for **WISP** holders because it reduces the overall amount of **WISP** tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### 

Fixed-Term Staking[](#fixed-term-staking)

Stake your **WISP** for a fixed amount of time to maximise yields and receive additional benefits! The staked **WISP** will be automatically compounded during the entire lock duration.

*   No performance fees
    

*   The longer you lock, the higher the boost applied to the yield! Always offering a higher APY compared to flexible staking!
    

*   **WISP** rewards are auto-compounded and will unlock, along with your staked **WISP**, when your lock duration expires
    

*   Once staked in fixed-term staking, you cannot withdraw until the end of your lock duration.
    

*   IFO **WISP** credit (the maximum amount of LFG they can commit during an IFO) will be determined from the fixed-term staking pool
    

**If you have WISP locked in fixed-term staking**

*   ✅ Add more **WISP** to lock
    

*   ✅ Extend lock period
    

*   ❌ Add **WISP** to flexible staking
    

*   ❌ Harvest rewards
    

*   ❌ Withdraw before locked term ends
