Yield Farming on WispSwap
=========================

**How does Yield Farming work on WispSwap?**

**1)** Firstly, anyone who Provides Liquidity in any pair on the DEX will receive **LP Tokens (LPTs)**.

**2)** If the pair you have provided has a **farm,** these LPTs can then be staked and start earning MIN tokens from that moment on.

**3)** Once you have staked your LPTs in a farm, you can withdraw your accrued WISP rewards **at any time**. Rewards will be calculated based on the second unit (**every second**), which means you **wonâ€™t need to wait a fixed period of time** to collect the WISP tokens you have earned. So, you can harvest any time that you have accrued rewards! But, we do advise **against harvesting rewards too often**, as you will incur _network fees_

**4)** If you add **additional LPTs** to a farm, the rewards accumulated since your last action (deposit or withdrawal) will be automatically calculated and sent to you. Then, you will start earning new rewards based on the new LP Token amount.

**5)** If you want to **withdraw a partial amount of LPTs** from a farm, the rewards accumulated since your last deposit or withdrawal action will be automatically calculated and sent to you. Then, you will start earning new rewards based on the new LPTs amount. If you **withdraw all the LPTs** staked in a farm, you will also automatically withdraw and receive all the WISP accrued until that point.
