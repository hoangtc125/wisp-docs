Yield Farming
=============

**What is Yield Farming?**

Yield Farming is an initiative used by protocols in _DeFi_ to incentivize liquidity and utilization by rewarding users in governance tokens (such as WISP). The idea is to acquire users by giving them **ownership of the protocol itself**, in accordance with the _ethos_ of decentralized protocols that are wholly owned by their users.

In WispSwap, this translates to distributing **WISP token rewards** to users who provides Liquidity on our DEX and stake their Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP Tokens or **LPTs**). Staking LPTs will earn you WISP rewards in proportion to how much the share the LPTs you are staking is compared to the total LPTs staked in the particular farm. WispSwap will aim to have an effective system for farming yield, while also offering the best user experience.
