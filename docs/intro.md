WispSwap Introduction
=====================

The protocol uses smart contracts developed by WispLabs team and written in Sui-move language.

**Thank You**

We're honoured that you're here keen to dive deeper into Infinity. We've gone to great lengths to ensure the product provides a robust experience, as it lays the foundation for Defi on Sui ecosystem.

We've created these set of docs to support the use of WispSwap. While we're building note that there may be some inconsistencies between what you read here, and what is available on the protocol. There may also be some errors (sorry!). We thank you for your patience as we get up to speed (i.e. Mainnet) and put more polish on the protocol.

While we don't currently have a bug bounty, or grants program, we intend to set one up in due course. If you spot an error, experience a bug, have a keen interest in getting involved or helping out in some specific capacity, please reach out to us on Discord or Twitter

**What is WispSwap?**

**Protocol, Interface, Labs**

*   WispSwap Labs: The company which developed the WispSwap protocol, along with the web interface.
    

*   The WispSwap Protocol: A suite of persistent smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-contracts market making and swapping of coins on the Sui blockchain.
    

*   The WispSwap Interface: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the WispSwap protocol. The interface is only one of many ways can interact with the WispSwap protocol.
    

The following is a brief overview of the _WispSwap Protocol_

WispSwap is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem.” One could define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, WispSwap’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, WispSwap intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.

Thus far, the core products, which will be described in more detail here, include: a decentralized exchange, a decentralized lending market, yield instruments, an auction platform, an AMM framework and staking derivatives. WispSwap’s products are configured in a way that allows the entire platform to maintain decentralized governance of $WISP token holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations by design. Whereas major structural changes are voted on by the community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing of pools and ratios, business strategy and overall development is ultimately decided on by our core team.

The following documentation details the functional and technical aspects of the ecosystem products, as well as customized tutorials to walk you through all of WispSwap’s exciting features!
