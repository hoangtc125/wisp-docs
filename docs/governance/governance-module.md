Governance Module
=================

WispSwap is a community-centric DEX. From the onset, tokens will be fairly distributed, without any private or VC investment. The community will guide the future of the DEX by providing input in several discussions on the WispSwap Forum. By implementing **on-chain snapshot voting**, Wispswap moves a step closer towards being a decentralized protocol that is wholly owned by its users. DAO governance decisions can range from allocating funds for a particular proposal, to deploying a new protocol/feature on the WispSwap platform, and everything in between.

In this first phase of the WispSwap Governance, the community will vote on major changes to the protocol, whereas smaller changes affecting operations, farm rebalances or onboarding of new farms, are decided on by the core team. While the vision and aim since the beginning for WispSwap has been to be fully in the hands of the community, DAO governance is a nascent and evolving area. Thus, the full adoption of **DAO governance** will be a progressive road.

WISP token is the governance token of the WispSwap DAO. Anyone may participate in the DAOâ€™s discussions, however only users with WispSwap governance tokens may vote on proposals. To ensure that all participants in the governance process have a vested interest in the success of the project, holders of WISP must first deposit it in the staking contract (see Voting process)
