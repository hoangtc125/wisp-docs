Tokenomics
==========

**What Is WISP?**[**​**](https://docs.animeswap.org/docs/tutorial/Tokenomics#what-is-ani)​

WISP is WispSwap native token. It represents the owner's rights, interests and benefits in the WispSwap protocol.

Currently, WispSwap is not deployed on Sui yet, announcement will be made once Sui is mainnet. If WispSwap and WISP deployed on other chains in the future, this documents will be updated.

#### 

Emission[​](https://docs.animeswap.org/docs/tutorial/Tokenomics#emission)​[](#emission)

The main distribution of emission is #staking-and-farm

DeFi is fast evolving, and WispSwap will keep evolving. If there are better direction for ecosystem growth, WispSwap will adjust emission distribution and rate via vote-and-governance.

​

**Usages**

**Staking and Farm**

WISP could be used into staking and farm to earn more WISP and other tokens.

Staking and farm are also the main part of emission WISP.

More about staking and farm see other documents (write in progress).

**Vote and Governance**

WISP could be used to vote and governance.

WispSwap community members could vote and governance on WispSwap protocol and ecosystem with WISP token.

Anyone with more than 0.1% of WISP supply can issue a new proposal, such as:

*   Change pair swap fee for better growth
    

*   How to distribute emission WISP for farm
    

*   How to allocate DAO Treasury
    

*   Developing new features
    

*   Deploy on other chains
    

*   ...
    

WispSwap Labs responsible for implementation proposals

Proposals and voting system is in progress.

**DAO Treasury**

WispSwap contract address has a DAO Treasury.

There are many ways of DAO Treasury income: part of swap fee, ecosystem cooperation, and WispSwap will develop more ways.

The ways of allocating DAO treasury are voted by community members

The purpose of the DAO Treasury is to help projects grow better, if there are no better allocating usages, the DAO Treasury will buyback WISP and burn.
