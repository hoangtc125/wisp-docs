User Flow
=========

Like most DEXes, Wispswap features two types of users: liquidity providers and traders.

### 

Liquidity providers[](#liquidity-providers)

Liquidity providers create new pools and provide liquidity for them (tokens X and Y) so that traders can execute swaps. In return, liquidity providers receive LP tokens. To redeem the liquidity together with the earned fees, they need to burn LP tokens.

Types of liquidity providers:

*   Traders who want to earn a passive income;
    

*   Project teams that wish to support their token's price and trading volume by providing initial liquidity;
    

*   DeFi protocols focused on passive income, experimental strategies, etc.
    

### 

Traders[](#traders)

Traders interact with a pool's smart contract to swap tokens X for Y or vice versa using the liquidity in the pool. For each swap, a trader pays a fee to the liquidity providers.

_Any AMM (DEX) transaction can be executed using the_ _Wispswap Dapp_ _or direct calls to the deployed smart contracts._
